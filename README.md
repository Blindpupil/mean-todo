# MEAN-TODO
A todo app with everything you'd need for a working full-stack web app with the MEAN stack.

M -> Mongo

E -> Express

A -> Angular

N -> Node

This could be the start(ing point) of something big.

## Setup
The usual: 

`$ git clone` this repo

`$ npm install`

`$ nodemon app.js`

or if you don't roll with that:

`$ node app.js` and have fun refreshing
